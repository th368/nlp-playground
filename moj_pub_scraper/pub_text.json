Staff in these roles transferred on the HR system between 1 April and 30 June 2017 and statistics presenting staff in post, as well as joiners and leavers, in this publication reflect these changes.

FTE figures are used as they take into account the different working patterns amongst staff. Considering variations in the number of hours worked by staff therefore provides a more accurate measure of the true/actual available resource compared to staff headcount. Where a member of staff works the standard hours for their grade they are counted as full time (1 FTE). Staff who work less than standard hours are allocated an FTE in proportion to their contracted hours and the standard hours for the grade. Work undertaken in addition to standard hours, such as overtime is not taken into account in calculating FTE.", "", "Data are not routinely available on working patterns other than full time/part time status since decisions on flexible working, working from home, and other aspects of working patterns are often handled at a local level.

Currently, there remains certain fields, defined as protective characteristics, which are not sufficiently populated to be able to present as statistics; however, it is intended that that coverage will increase over time.", "", "When considering the protected characteristics, it is the actual number of individuals which is important, and not the resource those individuals contribute. For this reason the only appropriate measure is the headcount, and not FTE. Caution should be exercised in attempting to make comparisons between the composition of the HMPPS workforce and the wider population of England and Wales on the basis of protected characteristics. There is substantial regional variation of these distributions in the general population, and HMPPS staff are not distributed across England and Wales in the same proportions as the general population, rendering such comparisons invalid.", "", "Data on the protected characteristics are collected from self-declared, non-compulsory fields on the Oracle HRMS and SOP databases (up to 31 December 2016 and after 1 January 2017 respectively).

With the exception of existing HMPPS staff who have re-graded to prison officer, the other staff movements relate to movements into or out of HMPPS rather than internal movements between sites and grades. The information have been taken from the Oracle HRMS and SOP databases. Data on joiners and leavers are continuously updated. The data covered in this publication has been extracted eight working days into the next month to accommodate as many late entries as possible while minimising the impact on timeliness. Nevertheless, given the nature of the data, time lags will still remain which is why the reported data points for joiners and leavers within the current financial year are marked as provisional pending the final running of the March data in April each year.", "", "Staff leaving on the final working day of a given month will appear both in the staff in post record for that month (having been employed by HMPPS on the last day of the month) and in the leavers record for that month (having left employment on the last day of the month).

Similarly the FTE recorded on leaving is often not representative of working patterns throughout the entire period of employment. For these reasons FTE on joining or leaving is a poor measure of the actual FTE resource the individual will represent or will have represented during their career in HMPPS. FTE figures for joiners and leavers will not reflect the changes to FTE of staff in post as continuing staff may change their FTE at any time. These are not data quality issues, but are inherent in the nature of staff data. Headcount figures are therefore used for all joiners and leavers tables. For joiners and leavers, the same breakdowns of region, function of establishment (category) and grade are provided. Reasons for leaving is also presented for leavers. However, since January 2017, information regarding dismissals has made no distinction between those as a result of medical inefficiencies and those which are due to unsatisfactory attendances. These two categories of dismissals have therefore been combined.", "", "HMPPS Leaver figures are also presented by protected characteristic. However, due to particularly low declaration rates, figures on the protected characteristics of HMPPS joiners have not been presented in this publication.

These are presented to enable easier comparisons of staff retention over time. To prevent the rates being distorted by factors such as the number of staff on fixed-term contracts, they relate to staff on permanent contracts only. Furthermore, exit schemes instigated by the Department involving voluntary early departure and redundancies are excluded so that only the behaviour of individuals is measured. For these reasons the number of leavers and staff in post used in the calculations are not the same as those presented in other parts of the bulletin. The underlying leaving rate of staff is therefore calculated by taking the number of permanent staff who left HMPPS (excluding leavers due to Voluntary Early Departure Scheme (VEDS), voluntary redundancy or compulsory redundancy) in the last 12 months and dividing by the average number of permanent staff in post in the last 12 months; this average is calculated as the mean of the start and ends of the year and the three quarter ends within the year.", "", "A new table has been included as from September 2018 which looks at the underlying resignation rate by grade.
