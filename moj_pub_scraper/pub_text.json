An individual\u2019s perception of, for example, their ethnicity may not align with what others would consider it to be, and in some systems it is possible for individuals to change their information at any time.

However, while the JAC Annual Report presents the number of applications for financial accounting reasons, this bulletin counts the number of applicants within selection exercises for diversity purposes. As a result, the number of applications, applicants and recommendations within selection exercises may differ slightly. Furthermore, when counting recommendations, the number of people who were recommended is counted, rather than the number of full-time equivalent vacant posts to which the recommendations refer.

Where a member of staff works the standard hours for their grade they are counted as full time (1 FTE).

For this reason the only appropriate measure is the headcount, and not FTE. Caution should be exercised in attempting to make comparisons between the composition of the HMPPS workforce and the wider population of England and Wales on the basis of protected characteristics. There is substantial regional variation of these distributions in the general population, and HMPPS staff are not distributed across England and Wales in the same proportions as the general population, rendering such comparisons invalid.", "", "Data on the protected characteristics are collected from self-declared, non-compulsory fields on the Oracle HRMS and SOP databases (up to 31 December 2016 and after 1 January 2017 respectively).

The information have been taken from the Oracle HRMS and SOP databases. Data on joiners and leavers are continuously updated. The data covered in this publication has been extracted eight working days into the next month to accommodate as many late entries as possible while minimising the impact on timeliness.

Similarly the FTE recorded on leaving is often not representative of working patterns throughout the entire period of employment. For these reasons FTE on joining or leaving is a poor measure of the actual FTE resource the individual will represent or will have represented during their career in HMPPS. FTE figures for joiners and leavers will not reflect the changes to FTE of staff in post as continuing staff may change their FTE at any time. These are not data quality issues, but are inherent in the nature of staff data. Headcount figures are therefore used for all joiners and leavers tables. For joiners and leavers, the same breakdowns of region, function of establishment (category) and grade are provided. Reasons for leaving is also presented for leavers. However, since January 2017, information regarding dismissals has made no distinction between those as a result of medical inefficiencies and those which are due to unsatisfactory attendances. These two categories of dismissals have therefore been combined.", "", "HMPPS Leaver figures are also presented by protected characteristic.

These are presented to enable easier comparisons of staff retention over time. To prevent the rates being distorted by factors such as the number of staff on fixed-term contracts, they relate to staff on permanent contracts only. Furthermore, exit schemes instigated by the Department involving voluntary early departure and redundancies are excluded so that only the behaviour of individuals is measured. For these reasons the number of leavers and staff in post used in the calculations are not the same as those presented in other parts of the bulletin. The underlying leaving rate of staff is therefore calculated by taking the number of permanent staff who left HMPPS (excluding leavers due to Voluntary Early Departure Scheme (VEDS), voluntary redundancy or compulsory redundancy) in the last 12 months and dividing by the average number of permanent staff in post in the last 12 months; this average is calculated as the mean of the start and ends of the year and the three quarter ends within the year.", "", "A new table has been included as from September 2018 which looks at the underlying resignation rate by grade.

Similarly the FTE recorded on leaving is often not representative of working patterns throughout the entire period of employment. For these reasons FTE on joining or leaving is a poor measure of the actual FTE resource the individual will represent or will have represented during their career in HMPPS. FTE figures for joiners and leavers will not reflect the changes to FTE of staff in post as continuing staff may change their FTE at any time.

For these reasons the number of leavers and staff in post used in the calculations are not the same as those presented in other parts of the bulletin. The underlying leaving rate of staff is therefore calculated by taking the number of permanent staff who left HMPPS (excluding leavers due to Voluntary Early Departure Scheme (VEDS), voluntary redundancy or compulsory redundancy) in the last 12 months and dividing by the average number of permanent staff in post in the last 12 months; this average is calculated as the mean of the start and ends of the year and the three quarter ends within the year.", "", "A new table has been included as from September 2018 which looks at the underlying resignation rate by grade.

Caution should be exercised in attempting to make comparisons between the composition of the HMPPS workforce and the wider population of England and Wales on the basis of protected characteristics.

With the exception of existing HMPPS staff who have re-graded to prison officer, the other staff movements relate to movements into or out of HMPPS rather than internal movements between sites and grades. The information have been taken from the Oracle HRMS and SOP databases. Data on joiners and leavers are continuously updated. The data covered in this publication has been extracted eight working days into the next month to accommodate as many late entries as possible while minimising the impact on timeliness.

Similarly the FTE recorded on leaving is often not representative of working patterns throughout the entire period of employment. For these reasons FTE on joining or leaving is a poor measure of the actual FTE resource the individual will represent or will have represented during their career in HMPPS. FTE figures for joiners and leavers will not reflect the changes to FTE of staff in post as continuing staff may change their FTE at any time. These are not data quality issues, but are inherent in the nature of staff data. Headcount figures are therefore used for all joiners and leavers tables. For joiners and leavers, the same breakdowns of region, function of establishment (category) and grade are provided. Reasons for leaving is also presented for leavers. However, since January 2017, information regarding dismissals has made no distinction between those as a result of medical inefficiencies and those which are due to unsatisfactory attendances. These two categories of dismissals have therefore been combined.", "", "HMPPS Leaver figures are also presented by protected characteristic. However, due to particularly low declaration rates, figures on the protected characteristics of HMPPS joiners have not been presented in this publication. This is currently being investigated and the intention is that the information will be included again in future workforce statistics publications.", "", "The bulletin also includes information on the leaving rate amongst HMPPS staff. These are presented to enable easier comparisons of staff retention over time. To prevent the rates being distorted by factors such as the number of staff on fixed-term contracts, they relate to staff on permanent contracts only. Furthermore, exit schemes instigated by the Department involving voluntary early departure and redundancies are excluded so that only the behaviour of individuals is measured. For these reasons the number of leavers and staff in post used in the calculations are not the same as those presented in other parts of the bulletin. The underlying leaving rate of staff is therefore calculated by taking the number of permanent staff who left HMPPS (excluding leavers due to Voluntary Early Departure Scheme (VEDS), voluntary redundancy or compulsory redundancy) in the last 12 months and dividing by the average number of permanent staff in post in the last 12 months; this average is calculated as the mean of the start and ends of the year and the three quarter ends within the year.", "", "A new table has been included as from September 2018 which looks at the underlying resignation rate by grade.
