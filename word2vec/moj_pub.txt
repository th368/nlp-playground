 Over the same period, the rate of self-harm incidents per [:NUM:] prisoners, which takes account of the reduction in the prison population between this and the previous year, decreased [:PERC:] in male establishments but increased [:PERC:] in female establishments.
 In the most recent quarter, there were [:NUM:] self-harm incidents, down [:PERC:] on the previous quarter, comprising a [:PERC:] decrease in male establishments and a [:PERC:] decrease in female establishments.

 Serious prisoner-on-prisoner assaults decreased by [:PERC:] to [:NUM:] in the [:NUM:] months to March [:NUM:] Serious assaults on staff also decreased, by [:PERC:] to [:NUM:]     Statisticians comment  In the [:NUM:] months to March [:NUM:] we have seen falls in the number of self-harm and assault incidents, and in the [:NUM:] months to June [:NUM:] we have seen an increase in the number of deaths.
 Statistics for these periods relate to the exceptional period since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, including reduced activity within the Criminal Justice System and the restricted regimes prisons put in place in order to safely manage the risks of infection during the pandemic (see Further Information at the end of this bulletin).
 Comparisons of these statistics with earlier periods will reflect the impact of Covid-19 as well as underlying trends.
  Deaths have increased by [:PERC:] to [:NUM:] deaths in the year to June [:NUM:] This has been driven by deaths related to Covid-19.
 However, in the latest quarter deaths fell by [:PERC:] to [:NUM:] from a peak of [:NUM:] in the previous quarter, and only two were suspected to be due to Covid-19.
 There were [:NUM:] self-inflicted deaths in the latest year, a small increase from [:NUM:] in the previous year.
  The number of self-harm incidents has fallen in the [:NUM:] months to March [:NUM:] by [:PERC:], comprising decreases of [:PERC:] in male establishments and [:PERC:] in female establishments.
 This partially reflects a fall in the prison population over the same period, with fewer receptions of sentenced offenders following reduced court activity in response to Covid-19 (as set out in Offender management statistics quarterly: October to December [:NUM:].
 With the fall in the prison population taken into account, the rate of self-harm incidents per [:NUM:] prisoners decreased by [:PERC:] in male establishments but increased by [:PERC:] in female establishments in the [:NUM:] months to March [:NUM:]  The number of assault incidents fell by [:PERC:] in the [:NUM:] months to March [:NUM:] including a [:PERC:] fall in serious assaults.
 In addition to reflecting the reduced prison population, this is expected to be influenced by the reduced contact included in prison regimes to reduce the risk of Covid-19 infection.
 Taking the fall in the population into account, assault rates decreased in both male and female establishments, by [:PERC:] and [:PERC:] respectively.
  Background  Safety in custody statistics cover deaths, self-harm and assaults in prison custody and HMPPS Immigration Removal Centres in England and Wales, with figures in the summary tables in the quarterly publications presented on a [:NUM:] month rolling basis over an [:NUM:] year time series [footnote [:NUM:] .
 This release provides statistics on deaths of prisoners to the end of June [:NUM:] and deaths from Covid-19 have been presented in the section below.
  The release also provides statistics on assaults and self-harm up to the end of March [:NUM:] The latest [:NUM:] month data reflects a full year since the outbreak of Covid-19, when Covid-19 restrictions were introduced in prisons to limit and control the spread of the virus.
 These restrictions included the implementation of effective isolation of prisoners, reverse cohorting of new entrants to custody, and shielding of vulnerable prisoners.
 See Further Information at the end of this bulletin on the managing and running of prisons during the pandemic.
  The total prison population has fallen since the first quarter of [:NUM:] falling more so for certain population groups [footnote [:NUM:] .
 As at [:NUM:] March [:NUM:] the total prison population was around [:NUM:] or [:PERC:] smaller than at the same point in the previous year [footnote [:NUM:] .
 The female population was reduced by [:PERC:], whereas the male population has reduced by [:PERC:].
  These changes in population should be borne in mind when interpreting changes in the numbers of incidents over the past year.
 In the context of substantial population change, rates per [:NUM:] prisoners more accurately describe changes in the likelihood of incidents occurring [footnote [:NUM:] .
 Data on deaths, self-harm and assaults are routinely presented as rates of incidents per [:NUM:] prisoners (as well as numbers) for all prisoners and the male and female estates.
 Additional commentary is offered where these rates indicate different trends to the numbers of incidents.
  Supplementary annual tables, providing more in-depth statistics on a calendar year basis, underlying data files with pivot tables providing lower level granularity, and a guidance technical document are also available alongside this bulletin, at  .
  Youth Estate  These statistics include incidents that occurred in the youth estate.
 However, readers should be aware of the  Safety in the children and young people secure estate  statistics bulletin.
 This provides quarterly statistics on assault and self-harm incidents, and deaths for children and young people in the secure estate.
 It is being published simultaneously to this Safety in Custody quarterly bulletin at the following link:   For continuity in the Safety in Custody data series, incidents in the youth estate and associated tables are included in this Safety in Custody bulletin, but readers are referred to Safety in the children and young people secure estate for commentary.
  Historically Safety in Custody statistics for the youth estate use an age-based definition for youth incidents, whereas the Safety in the children and young people secure estate statistics are based on the accommodation type.
 Both methodologies include all incidents occurring in dedicated under-18 Young Offender Institutions (even if theyre aged over [:NUM:] [footnote [:NUM:] .
 However, Safety in Custody statistics also includes all incidents in other establishments involving young people aged [:NUM:] to [:NUM:] Furthermore, Safety in the children and young people secure estate statistics also includes all incidents within the youth estate at Parc Young Peoples Unit and the under [:NUM:] part of Feltham as well as other custody settings holding under [:NUM:] previously not covered by Safety in Custody.
 For continuity and to align with the definition of the youth estate used in Safety in the children and young people secure estate, tables in this publication present data for the latest year(s) using both the historic methodology of Safety in Custody and also the methodology of the youth publication [footnote [:NUM:] .
   [:NUM:] Deaths: [:NUM:] months ending June [:NUM:]           Number of deaths increased from the previous [:NUM:] month period  In the [:NUM:] months to June [:NUM:] there were [:NUM:] deaths in prison custody, an increase of [:PERC:] from [:NUM:] deaths in the previous [:NUM:] months which corresponds with deaths related to Covid-19.

 In the most recent quarter there were [:NUM:] deaths, a [:PERC:] decrease from a peak of [:NUM:] deaths in the previous quarter.
    The number of deaths related to Covid-19 decreased in the most recent quarter  In the most recent quarter (April to June [:NUM:], there were 2 deaths ([:PERC:] of total deaths) that were suspected to be due to Covid-19, a decrease from [:NUM:] deaths ([:PERC:] of total deaths) in the previous quarter.
 In the same period, there were 3 deaths within [:NUM:] days of having a positive Covid-19 test or where there was a clinical assessment that Covid-19 was a contributory factor, a decrease from [:NUM:] in the previous quarter.
 There were [:NUM:] self-inflicted deaths in the most recent quarter, 6 less than in the previous quarter.
     Figure [:NUM:] Quarterly [:NUM:] month rolling rate of deaths per [:NUM:] prisoners, [:NUM:] months ending June [:NUM:] to [:NUM:] months ending June [:NUM:] with quarterly rates   In the [:NUM:] months to June [:NUM:] there were [:NUM:] deaths in prison custody (a rate of [:NUM:] per [:NUM:] prisoners), an increase from [:NUM:] deaths in the previous [:NUM:] months (a rate of [:NUM:] per [:NUM:] prisoners).

  Over the same period, there were [:NUM:] deaths due to natural causes (a rate of [:NUM:] per [:NUM:] prisoners), a [:PERC:] increase from [:NUM:] deaths (a rate of [:NUM:] per [:NUM:] prisoners) in the previous [:NUM:] months.
 This increase of [:NUM:] in deaths due to natural causes in the [:NUM:] months to June [:NUM:] reflects deaths from Covid-19 (with further information on these below).

  There were [:NUM:] deaths recorded as Other in the [:NUM:] months to June [:NUM:] [:NUM:] of which are awaiting further information prior to being classified.
 In some cases, the results of the toxicology and post-mortem tests are inconclusive, meaning classification cannot be arrived at until inquest (which can be a considerable time after the death).
 As a result, the number of deaths in the individual categories is not directly comparable with earlier years: it is likely that numbers in some categories will be revised upwards once classifications have been finalised.
  In the most recent quarter there were [:NUM:] deaths, a [:PERC:] decrease from a peak of [:NUM:] deaths in the previous quarter.
 This reflected a large decrease in deaths from Covid-19 (further information below) in the 3 months to June [:NUM:] following a peak in Covid-19 deaths the previous quarter.
 There were [:NUM:] self-inflicted deaths in the second quarter of [:NUM:] a decrease from [:NUM:] in the previous quarter.

  Deaths from Covid-19  From the start of the pandemic in March [:NUM:] to the end of June [:NUM:] [:NUM:] prisoners have died within [:NUM:] days of having a positive Covid-19 test or where there was a clinical assessment that Covid-19 was a contributory factor in their deaths regardless of the cause of death.
 Of these [:NUM:] deaths, [:NUM:] are suspected to be due to Covid-19.
 The remaining [:NUM:] deaths are believed to be due to other causes although the prisoner had tested positive for Covid-19.
  In the latest quarter (April to June [:NUM:], a lower proportion of deaths were related to Covid-19 than in previous quarters of [:NUM:]21.
 In this quarter, [:PERC:] of all deaths were of prisoners who had died within [:NUM:] days of a positive test for Covid-19, down from [:PERC:] of all deaths in the previous quarter.
 Similarly, deaths suspected to have been due to Covid-19 made up [:PERC:] of all deaths in the latest quarter, down from [:PERC:] in the previous quarter.
  As with all deaths in prison custody, each case will be investigated by the Prisons and Probation Ombudsman and subject to an inquest to determine the official cause of death and where necessary this data will be updated.

  Further information  Covid-19  Since the start of the Covid-19 pandemic, there has been keen public and Parliamentary interest in how the Ministry of Justice (MOJ) and Her Majestys Prisons and Probation Service (HMPPS) are managing the running of prisons and the probation system to limit the spread of the virus while maintaining the core functions of these vital parts of the justice system.
 The core tenet of HMPPSs prison strategy, building on Public Health England (PHE) and Public Health Wales (PHW) advice and learning developed in managing an early outbreak of the virus, is the implementation of effective isolation, reverse cohorting of new entrants to custody, and shielding of vulnerable prisoners.
  The latest Covid-19 figures are published monthly on the MOJ website via the following link:    Accompanying files  As well as this bulletin, the following products are published as part of this release:    A technical guide providing further information on how the data are collected and processed, as well as information on the revisions policy and legislation relevant to sentencing trends and background on the functioning of the criminal justice system.

    National Statistics status  National Statistics status means that official statistics meet the highest standards of trustworthiness, quality and public value.
  All official statistics should comply with all aspects of the Code of Practice for Official Statistics.
 They are awarded National Statistics status following an assessment by the UK Statistics Authoritys (UKSA) regulatory arm.
 The UKSA considers whether the statistics meet the highest standards of Code compliance, including the value they add to public decisions and debate.
  It is the Ministry of Justices responsibility to maintain compliance with the standards expected for National Statistics.
 If we become concerned about whether these statistics are still meeting the appropriate standards, we will discuss any concerns with the UKSA promptly.
 National Statistics status can be removed at any point when the highest standards are not maintained, and reinstated when standards are restored.
